# Galleria

A static gallery website driven from an input folder. 

Uses HTML, CSS, and JS to create a static gallery.  
Thumbnails are created for JPG and MP4 files and then delivered as a website with Lightbox navigation.  
Site structure mirrors the input folder, and a 'prune' function removes thumbnail files and folders if they are deleted from the input folder.
